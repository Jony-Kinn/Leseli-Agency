        <p><strong>STOP-SCROLLING CONTENT TURNING INTO MARKETING GOLD</strong><br>
        In today’s fast-paced digital world, attention spans are shorter than ever. . Visuals have a huge impact in it, from social media reels to website banners, visuals are not just eye-catching but they are a very powerful tool for communication. Whether launching a new product or building up a personal brand, high quality videos and creative photography have become essential for marketing success. Leseli Marketing Agency helps brands to tell their stories through scroll stopping visuals, combining quality photography with creative videos to boost reach. This essay will explore why visual story-telling is not just a trend but a marketing essential.
        Marketing segmentation, in a context of marketing a service, it simply refers to the process of dividing a broad target market into small and more manageable groups of consumers with the same characteristics, needs and behaviour according to (Limkokwing) principles of marketing (chapter 5). Therefore, under marketing segmentation, the Leseli Marketing Agency segments its consumers using demographic segmentation market, based on age, occupation and education.
        In this process of age segmenting, the agency focuses on age 15-35, due to most people around these ages have small businesses, personal brands and ideas to serve the world. Therefore it is going to make people to connect and be attracted by the visuals and videos promoted by this agency. Furthermore, occupation segmenting, the agency groups the consumers based on small business owners, artists and dancers. For example most village artists and dancers like pantsula and famo music dancers and artists wish to showcase their talents on social media platforms and other regions.
        As a final point of demographic segmentation, education segmenting, focusing on the levels of formal and non-formal education. High school students and tertiary students who often use social media and might be learning communication and also them being literate. Moving forward, according to principles of marketing (chapter 8) states that the product refers to the process of bringing an original product idea to the market. This agency is a creative agency committed to help businesses and individuals grow through powerful and creative short videos and images that tell a story. It specializes in promoting services and products for targeted customers and markets. It promotes photography and short video content conveying product shoots, corporate portraits or landscape, events and promotional videos.
        Secondly, from the point of view of (Zeithamal, 2018) stated that “price refers to how much one charges from their service or product and how they strategically set and communicate the pricing to attract the target market while remaining profitable. Therefore the agency uses price strategy to market photography and short video service to attract targeted market.” Cost based pricing and competitive pricing is one of the strategies it uses. This pricing strategies will cover costs plus profit and competitive pricing, set prices similar to or better than competitors. For instance, offering discount pricing of 20% for first time clients, seasonal promotions and starter package of M500 for 10 edited photos and 2 reels for 30 minutes for smaller businesses. 
        Thirdly, as stated by (Kotler, 2016) “place refers to how and where a product or service is made available to customers. So the agency decide to use physical location and digital platforms to promote photography and video content service for it’s targeted market to access and use the service.” Physical presence such as studio and mobile services are the places in marketing the service. For digital platforms online presence is to be used such as social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram including portfolio websites. Lastly, moving on to promotion, the agency will use the physical and social media to advertise the service
         Promotional tools, according to chapter 7 the major modes of communication in marketing are advertising, any paid form of non-personal presentation in promotion of ideas, goods and services by an identified sponsor, typical media that organisations utilize for advertising include television, magazines, newspapers, the internet, direct mail and radio. Businesses also advertise on mobile phones and social media.
        The Leseli Marketing Agency does not have a huge advertising budget. It is prompt to use social media as it’s biggest advertiser for a graphic designer to create digital adverts promoting our services, then pay Facebook and other platforms to boost it’s posts in order to gain a bigger fan base and clientele, and also use radio as other promotional tool as it is more affordable than advertising on billboards and has more advantages to a billboard.
         Furthermore, direct marketing as mentioned in principles of marketing (chapter 7) “it means communicating directly with targeted customer through telephones, e-mails or any other electronic means. Direct marketing allows a company to target more precisely a segment of customers and prospects with a sales message tailored to their specific needs and characteristics.” This promotional tool is the most effective tool when promoting photography and videography allowing the agency to target those individuals with upcoming weddings, baby showers, in graduations which will be very affordable and convenient for the agency.
        In addition, sales promotion also mentioned in (chapter 7)”short term incentives to encourage the purchase or sale of a product or service by the company in order to accelerate the product’s movement from the producer to the customer.” The agency offers packages to couples and graduates. For example pay for a shoot on your graduation and get 50% off.
